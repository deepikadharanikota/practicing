Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable
of intelligent behavior. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable machines 
to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI encompasses various subfields, including
 machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Machine learning, a subset of AI
 , allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit program
 ming. AI applications range from virtual assistants and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicle
 s and medical diagnosis. Despite significant advancements, ethical considerations and potential 
 societal impacts of AI continue to be important areas of discussion and research.
